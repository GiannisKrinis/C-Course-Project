Assignment in Computer Programming with C++

Academic Year 2023-24



Platform Game


Overview
The goal of this assignment is to create your own platform game, based on the Simple Graphics Library (SGG) developed for the course.

During the implementation, I combined knowledge I've gained from the lectures and carefully consider the architecture of my code to achieve:

    a) good code reusability,

    b) a consistent and polymorphic method-calling approach,
    
    c) efficient use of available STL structures, and
    
    d) performance.



SGG Library
This library (SGG) aims to provide a simple interface for students to include basic graphics, audio and interaction functionality in their applications 
written in C++. SGG offers an abstraction and simplification layer over SDL, OpenGL and other core windowing, graphics and audio libraries, providing 
a clear, simple and hasle - free programming interface to build from simple interactive applications to 2D computer games and data visualization tools.
